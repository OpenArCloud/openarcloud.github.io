# About Open AR Cloud

## Our Mission

Open AR Cloud's mission is to drive the development of open and interoperable spatial computing technology, data and standards to connect the physical and digital worlds for the benefit of all.

## Vision

We envision a future where spatial computing seamlessly integrates with everyday life, where digital information enhances physical spaces, and where open standards ensure that no single entity controls how we experience augmented reality. The Open Spatial Computing Platform represents our commitment to building this future collaboratively, transparently, and inclusively.

## How We Achieve Our Goals

### Open Standards Development
We collaborate with industry leaders, researchers, and developers to create and maintain open protocols that ensure interoperability across platforms and devices.

### Open Source Implementation
Every standard we develop has a corresponding open source reference implementation, ensuring that our vision is accessible to all and can be validated in practice.

### Community Collaboration
Through working groups, forums, and collaborative development, we bring together diverse perspectives to solve the complex challenges of spatial computing.

### Edge-First Architecture
We prioritize decentralized, edge-based solutions that respect user privacy, reduce latency, and enable true ownership of spatial data.
