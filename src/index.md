## Why Open Spatial Computing?

### Decentralized by Design
All OSCP services are designed to run on edge infrastructure (p-NET) rather than centralized cloud services, ensuring low latency and data sovereignty.

### Open Source Everything
Every OSCP service has open source implementations available on GitHub. All protocols are in the public domain and leverage existing open standards.

### Platform Agnostic
Client implementations support XR headsets, mobile platforms, robotics, and more - with libraries available for academic and commercial use.

## Core Components

- **Spatial Service Discovery** - Root-level registry for all spatial services
- **GeoPose Protocol** - Standard for positioning and orientation in space
- **Spatial Content Discovery** - Search and discover spatially-anchored content
- **Reality Modeling** - Support for BIM, IoT, GIS, USD, glTF, and 3D tiles
- **Edge-Optimized Rendering** - 5G-enabled cloud rendering at the edge
